Rendezvous
==========

A Location Sharing App
----------------------

### Idea
Rendezvous was created in 24 hours in a collaborative effort between Bruce Collie and JGM Software. 
It is a simple location sharing app that allows users to easily share 'waypoints', or their own location with each other.
